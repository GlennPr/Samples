This is a small demo project to setup a couple of abilities with Unreal GAS.
These abilities can trigger other abilities / events when combined:

FireBall (Left Mouse)
- Costs mana to use
- Does HP damage based on ability's level
- Cause an after burn which drains HP for a little while


Oil Ball (Right Mouse)
- Costs nothing to use
- Does no Damage
- Causes target to be saked with Oil for a while


IceBall (middle Mouse)
- Costs mana to use
- Drains target's Mana
- Causes target to be Frozen for a while


Combustion (auto triggered when fire and oil are both applied)
- does massive HP dmage
- causes existing oil to be burned up


Ice/Fire Cancellation (auto triggered when fire and ice are both applied)
- Causes fire and or ice effects to cancel eachother out, thus both are removed if present
